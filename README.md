Welcome to the only family friendly social media.
We pledge ourselves on safety and on helping those connect with their families.
<br>
<br>
Using our technology, you can essentially use Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media you want, but the only people who will see your content is your loved ones.
<br>
<br>

## connect.ily promises:
<br>
We promise to keep your data safe.
Only those added to your circle can see your information. 
You can add people to your cirlce using a very easy page called
"MyCircle."
This will ensure the only people who see your posts are those in your family. 
<br>
<br>
We promise to keep your kids safe. 
By adding kids to your circle, you are exposing them to anything they anyone could post.
There is an easy way to hide/report innapropriate posts to the Circle moderator who can remove them. Posts that are under investigation will be hidden immediately.
